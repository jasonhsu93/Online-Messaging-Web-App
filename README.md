## Design and Implementation

### Overview

The **Chat Summary** feature integrates the OLLAMA 3.2 AI model to generate concise summaries of chatroom conversations, enhancing user experience.

### AI Model Selection

#### Chosen Model: **OLLaMA 3.2**

- **Reason for Adoption:**
  - **Performance:** Effective text generation suitable for summarization.
  - **Cost-Effective:** Hosted locally, eliminating recurring API costs.
  - **Latency:** Reduced response times compared to external APIs.

#### Alternatives Considered

1. **GPT-4 by OpenAI:**
   - **Pros:** Highly capable in understanding and generating human-like text.
   - **Cons:** Requires API access with associated costs and potential latency issues.

2. **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers):**
   - **Pros:** Strong performance in understanding context within text.
   - **Cons:** Primarily designed for understanding rather than generating text; requires additional layers for summarization.

3. **T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer):**
   - **Pros:** Flexible for various NLP tasks, including summarization.
   - **Cons:** Computationally intensive for real-time applications; may require fine-tuning for optimal performance.

### Integration

1. **Client-Side (`app.js`):**
   - Initiates summary requests.
   - Displays summaries in the UI.

2. **Server-Side (`server.js`):**
   - Handles summary requests.
   - Interfaces with the AI model via a local API (`http://localhost:11434/api/generate`).

3. **AI Model Server:**
   - Hosts **OLLaMA 3.2**.
   - Processes summarization prompts and returns summaries.

**Workflow:**

1. User clicks **"Summary"** in a chatroom.
2. Client sends a GET request to `/chat/:room_id/summary`.
3. Server fetches messages, sends them to the AI model.
4. AI model returns a summary.
5. Server sends the summary back to the client.
6. Client displays the summary in a modal.
